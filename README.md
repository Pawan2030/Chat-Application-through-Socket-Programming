# Chat-Application-through-Socket-Programming
# Multi-Client Chat Application

This is a multi-client chat application implemented in C++ using socket programming and multithreading. The application allows multiple clients to communicate with each other through a server.

## Features
- Multiple clients can connect to the server and chat with each other.
- Each client can send and receive messages in real-time.
- The server handles multiple clients simultaneously using multithreading.
- Simple and easy-to-understand code structure.


### Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- Microsoft Visual Studio or any other C++ compiler that supports Winsock2

### Steps
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pawan2030/multi-client-chat-application.git

   Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio).

Build the project to compile the server and client executables.

### Usage
Running the Server
Run the server application:
Execute the compiled server binary (server.exe).
The server will start and listen for incoming client connections.
Running the Clients
Run the client application:
Execute the compiled client binary (client.exe).
Enter your chat name when prompted.
Start sending messages to the chat room.
